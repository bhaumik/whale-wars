# Farcaster Integration in Whale Wars

## Overview

Whale Wars integrates with Farcaster as a Mini App, allowing players to access the game directly from the Farcaster ecosystem. This document covers the specific integration points between Whale Wars and Farcaster.

### HTML Frame Metadata

In `index.html`, we include the necessary meta tag for Farcaster frame integration:

```html
<meta name="fc:frame" content='{"version":"next","imageUrl":"https://whale-wars.onrender.com/preview.png","button":{"title":"üê≥ Become a Whale","action":{"type":"launch_frame","url":"https://whale-wars.onrender.com?v=1","name":"Whale Wars"}}}' />
```

## Using the Frame SDK

We use the official Farcaster Frame SDK to integrate with the Farcaster ecosystem. For users already logged into a Farcaster client (like Warpcast), we automatically use their identity without requiring additional authentication:

```javascript
// Import the SDK
import { sdk } from '@farcaster/frame-sdk';

// Initialize the game with automatic user authentication
async function initGame() {
  try {
    // Get user context - this automatically provides user info when 
    // opened in a Farcaster client without requiring explicit login
    const context = await sdk.getContext();
    
    if (context.user && context.user.username) {
      console.log('‚úÖ User already authenticated through Farcaster client:', {
        username: context.user.username,
        fid: context.user.fid
      });
      
      // Use Farcaster user info for player data
      this.playerInfo = {
        name: context.user.username,
        fid: context.user.fid,
        // If available, use the user's profile picture as their avatar
        avatar: context.user.pfp?.url || this.defaultAvatar
      };
      
      // User is already authenticated, no further login needed
      this.isAuthenticated = true;
    } else {
      console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è No user context available, using anonymous mode');
      // Handle anonymous mode or optional explicit login
      this.playerInfo = {
        name: `Whale${Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000)}`,
        avatar: this.defaultAvatar
      };
    }
    
    // Hide splash screen when game is ready
    await sdk.actions.ready();
    
    // Initialize game with user context
    this.initializeGame();
  } catch (e) {
    console.log('üåê Running in standalone web environment', e);
    // Fall back to standalone mode
    this.handleStandaloneMode();
  }
}
```

## Authentication Flow

For Whale Wars, we use a multi-tier authentication approach:

1. **Farcaster Client Auth (Automatic)**: When the game is opened in a Farcaster client (Warpcast, Coinbase Wallet), we automatically retrieve the user's identity from the client context - no login required.

2. **Standalone Web Mode**: Only when the game is accessed directly through a web browser (outside a Farcaster client) do we offer explicit login options:

```javascript
async function handleAuthentication() {
  // First try to get context - this works automatically in Farcaster clients
  try {
    const context = await sdk.getContext();
    
    if (context.user && context.user.fid) {
      // User is already authenticated through Farcaster client
      return {
        authenticated: true,
        user: context.user
      };
    }
  } catch (e) {
    console.log('Context retrieval failed, might be outside Farcaster client');
  }
  
  // If we're here, we're likely not in a Farcaster client
  // Show login options ONLY for standalone web visitors
  if (this.isStandaloneMode) {
    this.showLoginOptions();
  } else {
    // Still in a Farcaster client but couldn't get context
    // Proceed with anonymous play
    return createAnonymousSession();
  }
}
```

This ensures that users already in a Farcaster client have a seamless experience without additional login prompts, while standalone web users still have authentication options.

## Using Farcaster User Information

When automatically authenticated in a Farcaster environment, the game uses the user's Farcaster identity:

1. Username as player name
2. FID (Farcaster ID) for unique identification
3. Profile picture as player avatar (if available)

## Social Sharing Integration

We enable players to share their achievements and game results with playful whale-themed messages:

```javascript
async function shareGameResults(score, rank, killedBy) {
  try {
    let text;
    
    if (killedBy) {
      // Player was eaten by someone else
      text = `I just got swallowed by @${killedBy} in Whale Wars! üê≥ Turns out I wasn't whale enough...`;
    } else if (rank === 1) {
      // Player was the top whale
      text = `I'm officially the BIGGEST whale on Farcaster! üê≥ Swallowed ${score} players in Whale Wars. Who dares challenge me?`;
    } else {
      // Player was ranked but not first
      text = `I was the ${rank}${getRankSuffix(rank)} biggest whale on Farcaster with ${score} points in Whale Wars! üê≥ Still growing...`;
    }
    
    const embeds = [`https://whale-wars.onrender.com/share?score=${score}&rank=${rank}`];
    
    await sdk.actions.composeCast({
      text,
      embeds
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sharing results:', error);
  }
}

// Helper function for rank suffixes (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
function getRankSuffix(rank) {
  if (rank % 10 === 1 && rank !== 11) return 'st';
  if (rank % 10 === 2 && rank !== 12) return 'nd';
  if (rank % 10 === 3 && rank !== 13) return 'rd';
  return 'th';
}

// Custom sharing for different achievements
async function shareWhaleAchievement(achievementType) {
  try {
    let text;
    
    switch (achievementType) {
      case 'first-whale':
        text = `I just consumed my first player in Whale Wars! My journey to become the biggest whale on Farcaster has begun! üê≥`;
        break;
      case 'whale-spree':
        text = `I'm on a whale spree! Swallowed 5 players in a row in Whale Wars! üê≥ The ocean trembles as I swim by!`;
        break;
      case 'mega-whale':
        text = `MEGA WHALE STATUS ACHIEVED! üê≥ I'm in the top 1% of whales on Farcaster. Even the crypto whales are taking notes!`;
        break;
      default:
        text = `Just made a splash in Whale Wars! üê≥ Swimming my way to the top of Farcaster!`;
    }
    
    const embeds = [`https://whale-wars.onrender.com/share?achievement=${achievementType}`];
    
    await sdk.actions.composeCast({
      text,
      embeds
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sharing achievement:', error);
  }
}
```

## Cross-Client Compatibility

The game is optimized to work across different Farcaster clients:

1. **Warpcast**: Primary client with full feature support
2. **Coinbase Wallet**: Optimized for the in-app wallet integration
3. **Other clients**: Graceful fallback for basic functionality

## Development Considerations

1. **Testing**: Always test in multiple Farcaster clients (Warpcast, Coinbase Wallet)
2. **Versioning**: Use URL parameters for version tracking (`?v=1`)
3. **Performance**: Optimize for mobile devices as most Farcaster users are on mobile
4. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle cases where Farcaster context is unavailable
