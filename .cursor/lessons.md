# Whale Wars Project Lessons

This file captures important lessons, fixes, configurations, and "gotchas" discovered during the development of the Whale Wars game.

## Fixes and Solutions

### WebSocket Connectivity
- Ensure the ping handler in the server uses the correct WebSocket reference
- Implement reconnection logic with exponential backoff to handle disconnections gracefully

### Canvas Rendering
- Always verify canvas existence before manipulating it to prevent null reference errors
- Implement a proper resizeCanvas method to handle window resizing

### Performance Optimization
- Implement entity culling to only render elements visible on screen
- Throttle position updates to reduce network traffic
- Use shorter field names in network messages to reduce payload size

### Security Best Practices
- Validate all client input on the server side to prevent injection attacks
- Use token-based authentication for WebSocket connections
- Implement rate limiting to prevent flooding attacks
- Add server-side validation for game mechanics to prevent cheating

## Configuration Tips

### Responsive Design
- Use media queries to adjust UI elements for different screen sizes
- Implement touch-specific controls for mobile devices with visual feedback

### Error Handling
- Create a notification system for displaying errors and game events
- Log detailed error information server-side for debugging

## Known Issues and Workarounds

- Double tap detection on mobile requires careful timing configuration
- Memory leaks can occur if event listeners aren't properly removed
- WebSocket connections may timeout in certain network conditions
