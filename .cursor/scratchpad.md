# Whale Wars Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

Whale Wars is a multiplayer browser-based game where players control whales, eat fish to grow larger, and compete with other players. The game is integrated with the Farcaster ecosystem as a Mini App, allowing players to access it directly from Farcaster clients.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. WebSocket connectivity issues between client and server
2. Proper Farcaster Mini App integration and configuration
3. Documentation organization and completeness
4. Browser console debugging for real-time error identification

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. ✅ Create comprehensive documentation for the project
   - Success criteria: Complete set of documentation files covering game architecture, WebSockets, Express server, and Farcaster integration

2. ✅ Update Farcaster Mini App configuration to latest specifications
   - Success criteria: Updated configuration in both `public/.well-known/farcaster.json` and HTML meta tags in `index.html`
   - Completed updates:
     - Updated `farcaster.json` to version 2 with new fields (description, categories, etc.)
     - Updated HTML meta tag to use the latest vNext format with image object and buttons array
     - Added a webhook endpoint in server.js to handle Farcaster Mini App interactions
     - Added reference to official [Farcaster MiniApps repository](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/miniapps) for examples

3. ✅ Implement WebSocket reconnection logic with better error handling
   - Success criteria: Client automatically reconnects to server when connection is lost, with proper exponential backoff
   - Completed updates:
     - Added dynamic WebSocket URL determination based on environment
     - Implemented exponential backoff with jitter for reconnection attempts
     - Added connection timeout handling
     - Added proper error handling with clear console messages
     - Implemented ping/pong mechanism to detect connection issues

4. ✅ Add WebSocket connection status indicator to the game UI
   - Success criteria: Players can see the current connection status with visual indicators
   - Completed updates:
     - Added connection status indicator in the UI with appropriate styling
     - Added status classes for connected, connecting, and disconnected states
     - Added ping time display to show connection quality
     - Implemented visual feedback for reconnection attempts

5. ✅ Implement enhanced logging for easier debugging
   - Success criteria: Structured logs with timestamps, categories, and severity levels
   - Completed updates:
     - Created comprehensive Logger class with log levels
     - Implemented categorized logging with timestamps
     - Added color-coded console output for different log levels
     - Included memory log storage for potential export
     - Added global access to logs via window._gameLogger and window.exportLogs()

## Project Status Board

- [✅] Documentation creation
- [✅] Farcaster configuration update
- [✅] WebSocket reconnection logic
- [✅] Connection status indicator
- [✅] Enhanced logging

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

We have successfully completed all the planned tasks:
1. Created comprehensive documentation for the project
2. Updated the Farcaster Mini App configuration to the latest specifications
3. Implemented improved WebSocket reconnection logic with better error handling
4. Added a WebSocket connection status indicator to the game UI
5. Implemented enhanced logging for easier debugging

## Final Checks

- ✅ Verified that the game is optimized for mobile-like view (as required for Farcaster MiniApps)
- ✅ Ensured WebSocket reconnection works properly with clear user feedback
- ✅ Confirmed that the Farcaster Mini App configuration follows the latest standards
- ✅ Added reference to the official Farcaster MiniApps repository for examples and best practices

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

All tasks have been successfully completed. The game now has:
1. Improved documentation with references to the official Farcaster MiniApps repository
2. Updated Farcaster Mini App configuration to the latest specifications
3. Robust WebSocket handling with automatic reconnection and user feedback
4. Enhanced logging system for easier debugging

## Lessons

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before trying to edit it
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
- When debugging WebSocket issues, check the browser console for exact error messages
- Keep Farcaster Mini App configuration up to date with the latest specifications
- Add connection status indicators for user feedback during network issues
- Implement exponential backoff with jitter for reconnection to prevent thundering herd problems
- Remember that Farcaster MiniApps always have a mobile-like view on both desktop and mobile
- Reference official documentation and repositories for best practices
