# Whale Wars Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

Whale Wars is a multiplayer browser game where players control whales in an ocean environment, eating fish to grow larger and competing with other players. The game integrates with Farcaster as a Mini App (Frame), allowing users to play directly within the Farcaster ecosystem.

The project has already implemented critical bug fixes, security enhancements, performance optimizations, and user experience improvements. The last remaining enhancement is to better utilize Farcaster's social features to increase engagement and virality.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Current Farcaster Integration**:
   - Game launches properly as a Frame using Farcaster's Frame SDK
   - Basic webhook endpoint exists for handling button interactions
   - Player data includes Farcaster ID (fid) when available

2. **Social Feature Opportunities**:
   - Achievement sharing: Allow players to share their accomplishments (high scores, killing larger whales, etc.)
   - Leaderboards: Post global and friend-based leaderboards to Farcaster
   - Game invites: Enable players to invite friends to join the game
   - Session recaps: Share game session stats after each play session
   - Custom visuals: Generate unique images for social shares based on achievements

3. **Technical Constraints**:
   - Need to respect Farcaster's rate limits for casting
   - Must ensure user privacy and consent for social sharing
   - Frame image generation needs to be performant
   - Social features should enhance, not disrupt, the core gameplay
