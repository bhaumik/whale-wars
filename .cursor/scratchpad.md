# Whale Wars Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

Whale Wars is a multiplayer browser game where players control whales in an ocean environment, eating fish to grow larger and competing with other players. The game integrates with Farcaster as a Mini App (Frame), allowing users to play directly within the Farcaster ecosystem.

The project has already implemented critical bug fixes, security enhancements, performance optimizations, and user experience improvements. Three of five planned social features have been successfully implemented: Achievement System, Dynamic Endgame Frames, and Leaderboard Publishing. The remaining work focuses on completing the Farcaster integration with Friend Invites and Farcaster Profile Integration, while ensuring the implementation follows the latest Farcaster Mini App specifications.
